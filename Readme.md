# Task Manager

It's and app where you can create task, edit and delete them.
There are two class model, one for the tasks and the other one for the users, I have use a relation between the models but in the user field, appears the global object and not the user name.


## Run the app
To run the app you have to use this sentence: python manage.py runserver and then enter to localhost with django port.
